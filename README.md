# 📊 SQL PRACTICE

This repository is created for learning and practicing SQL — from basic queries to more advanced data analysis.  
It contains exercises, mini-projects, and work with real datasets (including databases from Kaggle).

## 🔍 Scope
The repository includes SQL queries covering topics such as:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- `JOIN` (INNER, LEFT)
- subqueries
- CTE (`WITH`)
- data filtering and sorting
- basic analytical use cases (sales, users, vehicles, etc.)
